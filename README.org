Learning good pronunciation in a foreign language takes a lot of practice for most
learners. If the learner has no prior experience with tonal languages then achieving good
pronunciation is even more difficult. But coming from a tonal language learning a
non-tonal one might prove just as challenging.

Some literature (e.g. [1]) reports that imitation learning is highly effective not
only to acquire good pronunciation, but also to improve listening comprehension.

To my knowledge current Mandarin learning apps that do make use of the imitation technique
give graphical feedback only in the form of different colored syllables: e.g. SuperChinese
shows the syllable in red if the pronunciation matches very poorly, in gray the indicate
passing, and in green for a good match. The learner does not get more specific feedback
than that.

Tools used for phonology [3] or musicology [2] can and have been used for pronunciation
training with the imitation technique [citation needed]. Among their features is the
graphical display of pitch curves. Pitch curves give more feedback insofar as the user can
see, for example, that the pitch of their syllable drops where the corresponding syllable
in the target utterance remains flat.

However, these tools are not primarily targeted at pronunciation training and the user
experience of using these tools for pronunciation training is quite tedious. Some of the
drawbacks of using these tools are: they do not support many different file formats and so
the material to imitate might have to be converted before it can be used. Similarly, these
tools rely on external tools for cropping the part to be imitated from a longer
recording. Also, there are no versions of these tools for mobile devices, which might
actually be the greatest drawback.

The idea would then be to create a tool that:
- provides means to work with existing recordings locally (different file formats, tools
  for clipping and cropping, categorizing)
- runs the user through a convenient workflow of listening, imitating, comparing with
  their target
- connects the user to an online collection of target utterances shared by the community
- provides means to easily adapt to existing online sources (e.g. youglish)
- maintains records and statistics of the user's attempts

As possible extensions one could consider adding a party-mode: several learners pronounce
the same target utterance and each can hear the others' attempts, discuss them,...

Learners could flag their best imitations to showcase them for other users to see.

Another possible (maybe further away) extension could be to provide a purely
voice/speech-oriented user interface. Such an interface would make the tool accessible to
visually impaired persons, but it would also let users use the app in contexts in which
they need to focus their vision on something else, for example while driving a car. This
latter extension would let drivers use their commute time for pronunciation training. Of
course, there are also many unknowns here: how badly does a noisy environment affect the
usability of the app, for example.
